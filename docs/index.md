# MultipackParser Documentation

Welcome to the MultipackParser documentation! This application is designed to parse palette plan data and communicate with Universal Robots (UR) robotic systems.

## Overview

MultipackParser is a bridge application that connects **[Multipack](https://multiscience.de/multipack-ihre-optimierungssoftware/)** (a commercial optimization software for palette planning from Multiscience GmbH) with custom palletizing applications running on Universal Robots (UR10/UR20). 

The workflow is as follows:
1. **[Multipack](https://multiscience.de/multipack-ihre-optimierungssoftware/)** software generates palette plans from scratch based on input parameters (box dimensions, palette dimensions, etc.) and creates CSV files
2. **MultipackParser** reads and parses the palette plan files (`.rob` format) generated by Multipack
3. **MultipackParser** provides the parsed data to the custom in-house palletizing application running on UR10 or UR20 robots via XML-RPC

MultipackParser provides a graphical user interface for managing pallet configurations, monitoring robot status, and facilitating seamless data transfer between the palette planning system and the robot controllers.

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Check Version**
   ```bash
   python main.py --version
   ```

## System Requirements

- **Python**: >= 3.13
- **Operating System**: Linux (optimized for Raspberry Pi), Windows
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt` for complete list
- **Hardware**: Compatible with Universal Robots UR10 and UR20
- **Multipack Software**: [Multipack](https://multiscience.de/multipack-ihre-optimierungssoftware/) (commercial software from Multiscience GmbH) is required to generate the palette plan files that MultipackParser processes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This application requires robot-side components that are **not included** in this repository:
> - A specific **UR Program** must be installed and running on the Universal Robot
> - **URscript** code is required on the robot to interact with the XML-RPC server
> - These robot-side components must be obtained separately and configured on your Universal Robot controller
